# The Impact of Urbanisation on Agricultural Area and Forest Area
Correlational Analysis project of urbanism and area data of european countries from FAO with R conducted by Albert Figueras, Eduardo Pacheco, Yves Maillard and Daniel Podolecki.

In this group work, we will address the question of whether the amount of land used for agriculture is influenced by urbanization. 

The intuitive approach is to expect a negative effect of urbanization on agricultural land. Higher urbanization is often accompanied by population growth, which would automatically convert more agricultural zones into construction zones. In addition, it could be argued that urbanization causes former agricultural land to be used for unproductive recreational pursuits, e.g. hobby gardening, or horse keeping.

On the opposite side, it could be argued that an opposite effect could also occur: Higher urbanization could also mean that more people move from rural to urban areas due to the poor labour market situation, thus accumulating the population in the city and freeing up more land in the countryside. With this view, a positive effect of urbanization on agricultural land could be plausible.

The project consists of a R script and several Tableau maps based on the preprocessed data in R. The Tableau visualisations can be found on my Tableau Public account:
